## Installation

```shell
$ npm install -g wolkenkit-console
```

## Quick start

To run wolkenkit-console use the following command:

```shell
$ wolkenkit-console
```

This runs the application on port `9000`, so after that you can point your browser to <http://localhost:9000>.

_Please note that wolkenkit-console is meant for prototyping and testing domains, hence it does not (yet) work with applications that require authentication._
